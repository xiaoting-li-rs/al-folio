## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in fostering interdisciplinary thinking and practical problem-solving skills in environmental and energy sciences. My teaching approach emphasizes hands-on learning with real-world data, critical thinking about complex environmental challenges, and the development of technical skills that students can apply in their research and careers.
