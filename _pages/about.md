I am a Ph.D. candidate in Ecology at the Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, specializing in **data-driven energy systems research**. My work focuses on integrating multi-source Earth observation and deep learning approaches for dynamic urban energy demand modeling under climate variability and equity considerations, with the ultimate goal of supporting clean and resilient energy futures.

My research spans across **urban energy demand modeling**, **clean and just energy transition**, **energy poverty and access**, **climate impacts on energy systems**, and **energy equity**. I employ cutting-edge approaches including Earth observation, urban energy models, climate-energy-environment interaction modeling, high-resolution spatiotemporal analysis, and scenario-based assessment.

Currently, I am working on my dissertation titled *"Dynamic urban energy modeling through multi-source remote sensing and deep learning approaches"* under the supervision of Prof. Peng Gong. I have ongoing collaborations with the University of Hong Kong and have been a visiting student at Texas Tech University and Pengcheng National Laboratory.

My work has been published in leading journals including *Remote Sensing*, *Science Bulletin*, and *PNAS Nexus*. I am passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical applications for sustainable urban development and energy justice.
