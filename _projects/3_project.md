## Stage 2.5: Land Use Context for Energy Demand Proxies

This project bridges urban morphology and energy demand by incorporating functional land use information, recognizing that different urban functions have distinct energy consumption patterns and temporal profiles.

### Project Overview

Urban energy demand is not only determined by building characteristics but also by how buildings are used. This project develops innovative methods to map urban functions using novel Point of Interest (POI) and Area of Interest (AOI) datasets, providing critical context for energy demand modeling.

### Key Innovations

- **Novel Data Sources**: First application of comprehensive POI and AOI datasets for fine-grained urban land use mapping in energy modeling contexts.

- **Machine Learning Classification**: Development of Random Forest classifiers optimized for urban function identification using multi-source geospatial data.

- **Energy Use Profiles**: Direct linkage between functional zones (residential, commercial, industrial) and distinct energy consumption patterns and temporal profiles.

- **Cross-City Scalability**: Methodology designed for application across multiple cities with varying urban characteristics and data availability.

### Technical Approach

**Data Integration**:
- Point of Interest (POI) data providing business and facility locations
- Area of Interest (AOI) data defining functional boundaries
- Building footprint and morphology data from previous stages
- Demographic and socioeconomic indicators

**Classification Methodology**:
- Random Forest ensemble learning for robust classification
- Multi-scale feature extraction from POI density and diversity
- Temporal analysis of activity patterns using mobile phone data
- Integration with building morphology for context-aware classification

**Validation Framework**:
- Ground truth collection through field surveys
- Cross-validation with official land use maps
- Accuracy assessment across different urban typologies
- Uncertainty quantification and propagation

### Functional Categories and Energy Implications

**Residential Areas**:
- Heating/cooling dominated consumption
- Peak demand in evening and morning hours
- Seasonal variations in energy use patterns
- Population density effects on per-capita consumption

**Commercial Zones**:
- Daytime peak energy demand
- High electricity consumption for lighting and equipment
- Weekend/weekday variation patterns
- Building age and type effects on efficiency

**Industrial Areas**:
- Process-driven energy consumption
- Continuous or shift-based demand patterns
- High-intensity energy use per unit area
- Fuel type diversity (electricity, gas, steam)

**Mixed-Use Areas**:
- Complex temporal demand patterns
- Superposition of residential and commercial profiles
- Density effects on energy infrastructure efficiency

### Integration with Energy Models

The functional classification enables:

- **Demand Profiling**: Assignment of appropriate energy use profiles to different areas
- **Temporal Modeling**: Incorporation of activity-based temporal variations
- **Scenario Analysis**: Assessment of land use change impacts on energy demand
- **Policy Evaluation**: Analysis of zoning and development policies on energy systems

### Cross-City Applications

Methodology has been applied to:
- Beijing (primary case study with comprehensive validation)
- Multiple Chinese cities for scalability testing
- International cities for transferability assessment

### Uncertainty and Quality Control

**Classification Accuracy**:
- Overall accuracy >85% across major functional categories
- Confusion matrix analysis for systematic error identification
- Spatial accuracy assessment using high-resolution reference data

**Uncertainty Propagation**:
- Monte Carlo simulation for classification uncertainty
- Sensitivity analysis for energy model inputs
- Confidence intervals for energy demand estimates

### Future Developments

This functional mapping provides the contextual foundation for:
- Dynamic occupancy modeling (Stage 3)
- Policy scenario analysis (Stage 4)
- Integration with climate vulnerability assessments
- Real-time energy demand forecasting systems
