## Stage 1: Data Foundations for Energy Modeling

This project represents the foundational stage of my research agenda, focusing on developing innovative methods to extract urban structure information from sparse satellite LiDAR data for energy demand modeling applications.

### Project Overview

Urban energy demand is intrinsically linked to urban morphology and structure. Traditional methods for obtaining building height and urban structure information are often limited by data availability, cost, and spatial coverage. This project leverages the revolutionary ICESat-2 satellite mission to develop scalable methods for urban structure characterization.
