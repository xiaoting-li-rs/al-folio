## Stage 4: Equity and Policy Support

This project leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence to systematically analyze vast amounts of energy and climate literature, providing evidence-based foundations for policy development and equity-focused energy transitions.

### Project Overview

The transition to clean and equitable energy systems requires comprehensive understanding of existing research, policy frameworks, and implementation pathways. This project develops IntrAgent, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline for structured, large-scale analysis of energy and climate literature, bridging the gap between research and policymaking.

### Key Innovations

- **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Development of specialized language models fine-tuned for energy and climate domain knowledge extraction.

- **Structured Mining Pipeline**: Automated pipeline for systematic literature review, knowledge extraction, and synthesis across multiple research domains.

- **Policy-Research Bridge**: Novel methods to connect academic research findings with policy documents and implementation frameworks.

- **Scenario Integration**: Incorporation of policy assumptions as constraints in energy models to enable comprehensive scenario analysis.

### Technical Architecture

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
- Automated scraping of academic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar)
- Policy document collection from government and international organizations
- Text preprocessing and quality filtering for LLM input
- Multi-language support for global literature coverage

**LLM Pipeline Development**:
- **Base Model**: Fine-tuning of transformer architectures on energy/climate corpus
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Extraction of technologies, policies, and stakeholders
